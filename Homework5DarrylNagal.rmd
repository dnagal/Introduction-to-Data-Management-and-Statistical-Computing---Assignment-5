## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Assigning the csv file as SLSII after importing dataset
```{r SLSII_PFT_clin_baseline}
library(tidyverse)

SLSII <- read_csv("~/Downloads/SLSII_PFT_clin_baseline.csv")
```

## Str provides a concise summary of the dataset
```{r}
str(SLSII)
```

## Glimpse provides another summary of the dataset in a way that is easier to digest than Str
```{r}
library(dplyr)

glimpse(SLSII)
```

## Dim returns the dimensions of the dataframe
```{r}
dim(SLSII)
```

## Nrow counts the number of rows in the SLSII dataframe
```{r}
nrow(SLSII)
```

## Ncol counts the number of columns in the SLSII dataframe
```{r}
ncol(SLSII)
```

## 1:3 allows R to select the first three rows, while 1:5 after the comma selects the first five columns
```{r}
SLSII[1:3,1:5]
```

## Mean allows the calculation of the variable "age" in the SLSII dataframe, which is selected by using $
```{r}
mean(SLSII$age)
```

## Var calculates the variance of the variable "age" in the SLSII dataframe
```{r}
var(SLSII$age)
```

## Summary offers summary statistics which include the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and max values
```{r}
summary(SLSII$age)
```

## Na.rm stands for "not available, remove", and T declares the removal of missing values. This removes missing values before the mean is calculated
```{r}
mean(SLSII$age,na.rm=T)
```

## Stem generates a stem and leaf plot for the variable "age" in SLSII
```{r}
stem(SLSII$age)
```

## Boxplot creates a boxplot using the variable "age" in SLSII which includes the median, Q1, Q3, and whiskers 
```{r}
boxplot(SLSII$age)
```

## Hist creates a histogram for the variable "age" in SLSII
```{r}
hist(SLSII$age)
```

## Table creates a frequency table where 0 represents females and 1 represents males 
```{r}
table(SLSII$Male)
```

## A table is created where the rows represent gender/sex and columns represent treatment type
```{r}
table(SLSII$Male, SLSII$Treatment)
```

## The frequency values in the previous statement are now converted into proportions for the values which sum up to 1.00 horizontally. Also known as row-wise proportions
```{r}
prop.table(table(SLSII$Male, SLSII$Treatment), 1)
```

## Creates proportions going downward. Also known as column-wise proportions
```{r}
prop.table(table(SLSII$Male, SLSII$Treatment), 2)
```

## Creates porportions across all four boxes, or a grand total throughout the table
```{r}
prop.table(table(SLSII$Male, SLSII$Treatment))
```
